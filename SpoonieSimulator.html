		<div>Wow, all that getting ready really took it out of you! Time for lunch. What's it gonna be?</div>
		<div>Get the Mail (1 spoon)</div>
		<div>As a Responsible Human, you have some chores to do in order to keep your living space nice and tidy. Where should you start?</div>
		<div>It's been a few days since you've swept in here, so theres a few things that have accumulated, especially in the corners</div>
		<div>Sweep Kitchen (3 spoons)</div>
		<div>Spoons Remaining:</div>
		<div>A full garbage can is never fun, so you decide to take out the trash.</div>
		<div>Do Dishes (4 spoons)</div>
		<div>You decide to run and grab the mail. It's not too far, the fresh air is nice, and hey, you may even get a letter!</div>
		<div>Take out Trash (2 spoons)</div>
		<div>Do Laundry (5 spoons)</div>
		<div>It's never fun to eat cereal out of a pan, and you're getting close to that point! Better do the dishes before you're eating dinner on cookie sheets.</div>
		<div>Your stomach growls again. Must be dinnertime! You consider your options, and decide to make yourself a simple meal. Even though it takes some effort, the result tastes great. </div>
		<div>Goodnight!</div>
		<div>As you're finishing your day, you find yourself yawning. It's tough work, being chronically ill! You never realized the amount of effort it took to maintain normalcy until you became chronically ill. Good thing this was a light day!</div>
		<div>Begin</div>
		<div>This activity will take you through a day in the life of a spoonie, or someone who uses the Spoon Theory in their everyday life. You have a finite number of spoons, and a list of things to get done. Try to get as many of them done as you can, but don't feel bad if you can't! There is no way to lose or win, just different ways to play.</div>
		<div>Spoonie Simulator
</div>
		<div>The spoon theory is a way to explain chronic illness to people who might not understand what it's like to have a chronic illness, using spoons as a way to show someone's energy level. Each person has a certain amount of energy in a day, and they can 'spend' a number of spoons to complete tasks and chores.
When someone is out of spoons, they aren't able to do anything that takes energy until they have regained more spoons by doing something fun, eating, or resting. Every day activities take spoons, even things that you might not realize!</div>
		<div>Welcome to Spoonie Simulator a 'choose your own adventure' style project where you play as someone with a chronic illness, navigating a simple and quiet day in their life. This was made by Riley Kunz for the DGIM 2521 final. </div>
		<div>A chronic illness is a kind of sickness that sticks around and you don't get better from like you would from a cold or the flu. Being chronically ill takes a lot of energy, which is why Christine Miserandino created something called the 'Spoon Theory'.

</div>
		<div>Things like making breakfast, taking a shower, and getting dressed are all things that can take spoons from someone who is chronically ill. Sometimes chronically ill people will have to wait several days to do something if it takes a lot of spoons.
Most of the time, going to bed and waking up will completely replenish someone's supply of spoons, but sometimes a chronically ill person will wake up and have less than their average amount of spoons. On those days, it's usually difficult to get out of bed and do anything, because they don't have enough energy to get started.</div>

</div>
		<div>You Have 0 Spoons Left!</div>
		<div>You overworked yourself today, and you have 0 spoons left. You were so tired from your tasks today that you fell asleep on the couch after finishing the last one you did. Thats okay though, you can always try again tomorrow!</div>
		<div>REFRESH TO TRY AGAIN</div>
		<div>You Finished Your Day!</div>
		<div>You didn’t run out of spoons today, good for you! You might not have gotten everything done that you wanted to do, but you were able to make it through the day without getting exhausted. You’re going to sleep well tonight, and tomorrow you can try again!
